# OMDB Clone

You are going to make a movie clone page for OMDB. Your movie clone should be able to search for a OMDB movie title using an ajax request to the OMDB api.  The results should be displayed on the screen.

The results should have the following:

1. The Movie Title
2. The Release Year
3. The Movie Poster

### APIs You Will Need

* [OMDB api](http://www.omdbapi.com/)

A large part of the assignment will be getting familiar with looking at documentation.  Try to figure out what the api has to offer by looking at the docs.

### Styling

Make the website a little prettier.  You can modify the html to make it look nicer.  Just don't change the html for any content changes.
